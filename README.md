# 🗂️ Appointment System with Windows Form

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a small **Windows Form application** developed with the **DB First** approach.  
The purpose of the application is to connect to the database, improve algorithmic thinking, and practice decision making through an appointment system.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- When the application is opened, the **doctor list**, **appointment types**, and **available hours** are automatically loaded into the comboboxes.  
- The user enters **name** and **surname**, selects a **doctor**, **appointment type**, **date**, and **time**, and then saves the appointment.  
- The system generates a **unique Id** for each appointment, calculates the **end time** automatically, and saves the data into the database.  

## 🎯 Purpose
Through this process:  
- Users experience the **appointment creation flow** step by step.  
- Developers can practice **CRUD operations**, **data loading**, **automatic calculations**, and **form management**.
